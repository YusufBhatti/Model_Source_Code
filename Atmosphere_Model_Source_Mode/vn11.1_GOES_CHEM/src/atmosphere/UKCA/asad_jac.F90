! Purpose: To compute the main diagonal of the Jacobian matrix df/dy
!     where f is dy/dt. The IMPACT time integration scheme uses
!     the main diagonal.
!
!  Part of the UKCA model, a community model supported by
!  The Met Office and NCAS, with components provided initially
!  by The University of Cambridge, University of Leeds and
!  The Met. Office.  See www.ukca.ac.uk

!
!        On exit, the array ej will have been updated.
!
!     Method
!     ------
!     The production term resulting from  a particular reaction
!     is given by P = k*Y1*Y2, or P = J*Y1 for photolysis and
!     P = K*Y1 for thermal decomposition. It is the same for all
!     products. The loss term for reactant 1 can be either
!     L1 = k*Y2 or L1 = J for photolysis and L1 = K for thermal
!     decomposition. The loss rate for reactant 2 , if present,
!     is L2 = K*Y1.  These terms are stored in the array prk.
!
!     The main diagonal Jacobian elements are calculated for
!     each family/tracer by differentiating d(fdot)/df.
!     Considering the term due to each individual reaction:
!     If neither of the reactants are
!     members of the family/tracer, the term for the reaction is
!     zero. However, if one of reactants is a family member, a
!     term  - N*k*Y1*(Y2/F) should be added to the Jacobian element.
!     N is the net number of odd atoms of that family/tracer type
!     resulting from the reaction (calculated in inodd). Since
!     P = k*Y1*Y2 has already been calculated, we add N*P to the
!     running sum. The division by F, the family concentration is
!     done at the end of the subroutine.
!     If both reactants are members of the same family/tracer, the
!     term due to the reaction is  - 2*N*k*Y1*(Y2/F) where the
!     factor 2 results from the differentiation of the F^2 term,
!     and so 2*N*P is added to the running sum.
!
!     Deposition terms:
!     Since emissions are generally atmospheric concentration
!     independent, they do not enter the expression for the main
!     diagonal Jacobian elements. However, deposition is a first order
!     loss process and so the Jacobian elements must also be updated.
!     The loss rate of a family due to deposition of one of its
!     members is given by -N*dp*(Y/F)*F where N is the number of odd
!     atoms in the species of the family type and dp is the loss rate.
!     The Jacobian element is given by dfdot/df, and so a term =
!     -N*dp*(Y/F) must be added to the Jacobian element. Since the
!     final division by F is done at the end, the term added to the
!     sum kept in memory is -N*dp*Y.
!
!     Externals
!     ---------
!          None.
